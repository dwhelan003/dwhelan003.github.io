<p>At My Pet's Health, we work with vets to deliver a centralised database of your pet's health history. 
<br>
Let us keep track of your pet's health in one place, so you can focus on the most important part of owning a pet...having fun!</p>

<h3>Our services include:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Keeping track of all your loved one's visits to the vet, along with a detailed history</li>
	<li>Easy transfer of a full health history to a new vet if you need to change for any reason</li>
	<li>If Fido does get sick, you can claim off your pet's health insurance directly from our easy-to-use interface</li>
	<li>Find other pets similar to yours near you and arrange play dates so you can put your feet up!</li>
</ul>
